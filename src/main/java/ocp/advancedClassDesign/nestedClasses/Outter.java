 * Definition:
 *
 * A top level class is a class that is not a nested class.
 * A nested class (member class) is any class whose declaration occurs within the body of another class or interface.
 * An inner class is a nested class that is not explicitly or implicitly declared static.
 *
 * The modifier static pertains only to member classes, not to top level or local or anonymous classes.
 * That is, only classes declared as members of top-level classes can be declared static.
 * Package member classes, local classes (i.e. classes declared in methods) and anonymous classes cannot be declared static.
 *
 *
 * Questions that you have be able to answer:
 *
 * 1) Which variables declared in the encapsulating class or in the method, can an inner class access if the inner class is defined in a static method of encapsulating class?
 * 2) Which variables of the encapsulating class can an inner class access, if the inner class is defined in an instance method of the encapsulating class?
 * 3) An inner class can extend its outer class?
 * 4) What classes can a non-static nested class extend ?
 *
 * TIPS:
 *
 * When you create an anonymous class for an interface, it extends from Object.
 * But if you make an anonymous class from another class then it extends from that class. For example, consider the following class:
 *
 * A static nested class can contain non-static member variables.
